A small toy company, as part of its campaign, has announced an open competition to arrange
a few boxes of toys in an order in a short time and win an impressive prize.  
Boxes with Toys are labelled (1) and Empty boxes (0). Mihika wants to participate and win a prize.   
The company places N boxes, both filled with Toys (1) or Empty (0), in a row in a container. 
Mihika must arrange all boxes in a line/row such that all empty boxes must 
follow the boxes with toys i.e., first all ones (1) then all zeros (0). 
There can be several rounds of arrangement till all the boxes are arranged as per the rule. 
In each round, Mihika, can swap empty box (0) with only with its adjacent filled box (1).
A box, either with toy or empty, can swapped only once in a round.  
Given, the total number of boxes (N) and the initial order of boxes as a series of 1s and 0s, 
write a program to find the minimum number of rounds needed to arrange the boxes as defined above.
